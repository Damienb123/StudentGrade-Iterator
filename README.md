## Overview

The Collections interface extends Iterable<Object> and provides a method to iterate over objects. The main method demonstrates the usage of a LinkedHashMap to store student names and their respective scores. The program includes functionalities to:

- Iterate through all entries.
- Filter and display passing scores (>= 75).
- Filter and display failing scores (< 75).
- Map student names to a list.

## Features

- Iterate Over Entries: Display all student names and their scores.
- Filter Passing Scores: Display student names and scores for scores greater than or equal to 75.
- Filter Failing Scores: Display student names and scores for scores less than 75.
- Map Student Names: Create a list of all student names.
